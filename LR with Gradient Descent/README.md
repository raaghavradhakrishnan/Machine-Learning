# Linear Regression via Normal Equations

Implement linear regression algorithm with gradient descent algorithm.

## Tasks

**Dataset preprocessing and exploration\:**  Airfare and demand (http://www.stat.u.edu/ winner/data/airq402.dat) and Wine Quality (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

**LR with Gradient Descent\:** Implemented LR with *Least square loss function* and included Step Lengths, *Armijo and Bold Driver* for Gradient Descent
