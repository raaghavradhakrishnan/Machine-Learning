# Linear Regression via Normal Equations

Implement linear classification with gradient descent algorithm for marketing and occupany datasets.

## Tasks

**Dataset preprocessing and exploration\:**  
Bank Marketing (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) and Occupancy Detection (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection)

**Linear Classification with Gradient Descent\:** 
Implemented linear classifiction with *stochastic gradient descent* to optimize log-likelihood function and included ** *AdaGrad* **for adaptive step length.
