# Machine Learning Lab Projects

This repository contains the developemnt of Machine Learning Projects as a part of the ML Lab Course in the Data Analytics master program at University of Hildesheim.

## Implementations and Tasks
1. Linear Regression with Normal Equations, Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. Regrularization and Hyperparameter Tuning
3. Linear Classification/Logistic Regression
4. Generalized Linear Models
5. Polynomial Regression
6. Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Decision Trees (Random Forest and Gradient Boosted)
8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
9. Clustering (K-Means)
